TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Toshiba Corp (6502.T) is locked in last minute discussions over “key issues” with the would-be buyers
of its $18 billion memory chip business led by U.S. private equity firm Bain, potentially delaying a formal agreement on the sale.
Toshiba said on Wednesday it had agreed to sell the prized unit to the Bain consortium, and had been expected to formalize the sale on Thursday.
Instead, South Korea’s SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS), part of the winning consortium, said talks were still ongoing. Sources familiar with the matter confirmed
consortium members were still wrangling over details of their agreement and said commitment letters from all participants were still needed before the sale
could be signed formally.“There are some key issues still to be agreed upon in the content approved by Toshiba’s board,”
the South Korean chipmaker said in a statement, adding that it would continue talks.Toshiba and Bain did not immediately reply to a
request for comment.Adding to uncertainty, jilted suitor and Toshiba joint venture partner Western Digital (WDC.O) took fresh legal action overnight,
filing new arbitration requests to stop Toshiba investing in a new flash memory production line without its help.
